/**
 * Keeps track of allocating and associating native "tags" which are numeric,
 * unique view IDs. All the native tags are negative numbers, to avoid
 * collisions, but in the JS we keep track of them as positive integers to store
 * them effectively in Arrays. So we must refer to them as "inverses" of the
 * native tags (that are * normally negative).
 *
 * It *must* be the case that every `rootNodeID` always maps to the exact same
 * `tag` forever. The easiest way to accomplish this is to never delete
 * anything from this table.
 * Why: Because `dangerouslyReplaceNodeWithMarkupByID` relies on being able to
 * unmount a component with a `rootNodeID`, then mount a new one in its place,
