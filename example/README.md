## Example App

This is a small example app to test sglistview.

**NOTE**: The app requires the clientId/clientVersion for making the api call which isn't under Version Control... so the app probably won't work for you :(

```
file: ./config/clientId.js

module.exports = {
  clientId: '', # can't include clientId here for security reasons
  clientVersion: '16.2'
};
```
